                            splendidly rendered, In the other records the personality of the artist
                            was in evidence, but as Tamagno had died before the cinematograph
                            reached its present stage of perfection, a pathetic interest attached to

                        dinner, last night at Shepheard’s hotel, and presented with a gold watch
                        as a souvenir of his in Egypt</p>
                    <p>Dr. Clark took the chair and in proposing the toast of the guest of the

                        made him into a musician. It was a surprising thing for any stranger
                        coming to a land like Egypt, where few of. the people Could even sign
                        their own names to bar Egyptian bands playing., all sorts of selections
                        of European music, ranging from the latest light opera to the

                        out of Nil! mud. All this referred to his professional services to the
                        Egyptian Army. But the gathering at dinner did not represent the army,
                        but only a few civilian friends still left at the end of the season ;
                        and to them it would be even more interesting to recall Lieut Franklin's
                        splendid services in the cause of charity. Some years ago ho composed
                        and produced, in the cause of charity, his opera "Sesostris,” which they
                        might -one day see in-print; and more recently they had not forgotten
                        that memorable performance of 'The Pirates of Penzance” before the Duke
                        of Connaught, which realized toe record sum of over £1fl0 in an Opera
                        House which at foil Opera prices could, only hold £250, an occasion when
                        one stall alone sold for £50, which is probably a record for the Whole
                        world. Lieut. Franklin pulled this performance successfully through
                        although Working with amateur talent which, with all respect to. those
                        present could only be described as distinctly raw.</p>

                    <p>Lieut Franklin in reply made some most interesting remarks on the
                        capacityof Egyptians for music. He said that as reference had been made
                        to his professional work he must say that on*reason for the result
                        obtained was the splendid material that ho had to work with. He had
                        trained Lands in England, in Burma and else-where, but nowhere in the
                        world, he asserted emphatically, had he found such apt pupils as the
                        Sudanese. Music, he said, was in them. This statement, coming from such
                        a high authority as Lieut Frank- klim must be very gratifying to the
                        native regiments.</p>
                    <p>Lieut Franklin further spoke of the great consideration and kindness
                        which he had received in his work from H.H. the Khedive, himself an
                        excellent judge of music. As to the “Lord Cromer” chronometer he. would
                        greatly prize a gift that bore the name of the great statesman whose
                        departure had ceased so much regret, but he could not, promise to wear
                        the souvenir on every occasion for it must regret precedence to the
                        watch he most dearly prized which was. given him by his own sergeants.

                    <p>The following is a translation of the letter addressed to the board of
                        directors ,by the delegate* of the Ottoman, Anglo-Egyptian and

                    <p>Gentlemen—. At your request and using as a basis the various situations
                        placed at oar disposition, we have preceded to approximate evolution the
                        total assets of the Casta and we herewith append the details of the
                        “dechets” under the various headings-. Our investigation has necessarily
                        been hasty, and we have not, it should be noted, been able to appreciate
                        the regularities in regard to the mortgage properties. It must be
                        understood that in oar valuation we have not considered the eventuality
                        of a forced liquidation, but have considered, the case of the
                        continuation, of the business- or, at any rate, of a friendly, gradual
                        and methodical liquidation. We beg to state that this valuation has'
                        been conducted conscientiously and in accordance with our experience of
                        business in 'general without any responsibility on your part.</p>

                    <p>The “Manchester Guardian,” in its commercial notes remarks:</p>
                    <p>The strength of the cotton market-in Egypt is little short of remarkable
                        in view, of the collapse in stock* since the great majority of Egyptian
                        speculators are interested in both, and tremendous losses have been
                        experienced the stock market. The speculative position in cotton
                        i*‘however, a somewhat elusive one at present. Our Alexandria
                        ’correspondent, writing on June 16, says that 'the fluctuations of the
                        week just closed amount in the abstract to a rise of 3-32T. on the old
                        crop and a fall of 3/16T. on the new July closing at 20} and November at
                        ' 20, after touching 20} and 20 11/16 respectively during the week: It
                        had been anticipated that 10,000 bales would be shipped during the week,
                        but the actual shipments only totaled 8,600 bale* against 4,000 last
                        year, and this disappointment undoubtedly checked the rise. As the
                        difference between this and last year’s shipments now amounts to less
                        than 10,000 bale* the disparity will soon be levelled if the present
                        rate of exportation continues. Notwithstanding the semblance of activity
                        which still sustains price* due among r causes to the report that a
                        Liverpool syndicate had been formed to operate on the July disparity of
                        price, it Is evident that America governs the market, and that there is
                        no particular strength at the bottom of Egyptian speculation apart from
                        this.”</p>
